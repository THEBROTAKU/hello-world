# hello-world
First repository
Hello. Thought I would try out this cool thing called github.
I am a electronics hobbyist that is only now getting into the world of programming.
I do a digital technologies course in my high school so I may be posting some of those projects here. These will include some python and some html
I am also part of a VEX Robotics team (2903S) so I may post some of my robots code.
